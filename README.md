This is a Danish keyboard layout for Windows that replicates the macOS layout as closely as possible, released under the MIT license.

It's built using a [Microsoft utility](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) that makes it very easy to create a new keyboard layout.

On Windows the left option/alt key is reserved for accessing the menu, to access the special characters you have to use the right alt key (called AltGr on a PC). A minor annoyance which is quickly adjusted to.

On a Mac laptop we don't have the AltGr key, in Windows you can emulate it by pressing ctrl+option but this is cumbersome. Microsoft have released a powertoy (remapkey.exe, part of [Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17657)) that is able to reassign the keys' functions, this can be used to make the right Apple/command key an AltGr key in Windows. Protip: You can press fn+backspace to get forward delete but using the remapkey utility you could also map the extra enter key to forward delete, if you miss it.
